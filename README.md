# 🚀 n8n Workflow Automation
## 📌 Overview

This repository contains an n8n workflow designed to automate repetitive tasks efficiently.
By connecting multiple services and handling both JSON and binary data, the workflow ensures smooth data processing, error handling, and output delivery.

## ⚙️ Features

🔄 Automated Workflow Execution — eliminates manual intervention.

📂 Binary File Handling — supports file/image downloads and uploads.

🔗 Integration with APIs — connects with third-party services seamlessly.

⚡ Error-Resilient — properly configured for reliable runs.

## 🏗️ Workflow Structure

Trigger Node – starts the workflow on a specific event or schedule.

HTTP Request / Data Fetch – retrieves data or files.

Move Binary Data (if needed) – converts JSON to binary or vice versa.

Processing Nodes – transforms, validates, or routes data.

Output Node – sends the result to a destination (e.g., LinkedIn, Telegram, Google Drive).

## 📋 Requirements

n8n
 installed locally or hosted.

API credentials/tokens for the services you want to connect.

Proper configuration of binary data handling (data property).

🚀 Getting Started

Clone this repository:

      git clone https://github.com/SEPT-11/Agentic-Workflow.git
      cd Agentic-Workflow


Import the workflow into your n8n instance.

Update credentials inside n8n for your services.

Run the workflow and verify execution.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

Error: This operation expects the node's input data to contain a binary file 'data'

✅ Enable Download in HTTP Request nodes.

✅ Use Move Binary Data if converting JSON → Binary.

✅ Ensure binary property is set to data.
